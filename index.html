        <p>Due to a lot of similar aesthetic cues and colors, to the untrained eye, it's easy to confuse the aesthetics of both Synthwave and Vaporwave (and some people have tried to make politically motivated aesthetics that do, indeed, confuse the two aesthetics and assume they are the same). Let it be known; they are, indeed, two completely separate aesthetics with two completely different goals in mind. </p>

        <p> While Vaporwave is a bit more tongue-in-cheek and can be seen in certain lights as being critical of the capitalist system and may or may not be making some sort of political statement with their co-opting of '80s-'90s corporate symbolism and is more "wink-wink-nudge-nudge" with the cheesy elements of this, Synthwave is more of a genuinely earnest celebration of all things '80s (and now '90s, since a lot of Synthwave artists are starting to expand their scope and are playing with a more '90s-centric sound and imagery, which can lead to further muddying of the waters between what is Synthwave and what is Vaporwave) in all of its cheesy, over-the-top glory. </p>

        <img src="images/vaporwavebeach.jpg" class="size" align="left">
        <p>This confusion is also not helped due to the fact there have been several instances of Synthwave AND Vaporwave artists collaborating on projects (most notably, Synthwave artist Bart Graft has collaborated with Future Funk artist Bubble Keiki to make the album Emerald.)

        In short, the main difference between Synthwave and Vaporwave is Vaporwave tends to be more ironic while Synthwave tends to be more earnest with their embracing of '80s and '90s aesthetics.
