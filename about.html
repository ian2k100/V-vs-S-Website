        <h2 class="headertext">Music</h2>
        <p>Vaporwave was first characterized by its heavy use of samples from the 1980s and 1990s music, typically lounge, smooth jazz, or Muzak. Samples are often pitched down, layered, or altered in classic chopped and screwed style. Defined by slowed down song samples and loops of eerie, droning effects. This evokes the mood of a slow, relaxed vibe with deep, bass-inspired sounds and strange vocals.  While slowed music can sometimes be disturbing to listeners, many hype that aspect to be the best part about Vaporwave. The low, gloomy sounds can provide an oddly soothing effect and when paired with vintage imagery, the art proves to be truly powerful. However, vaporwave has started to incorporate more original compositions with a heavy focus on ambiance. </p>

        <h2 class="headertext">Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>Vaporwave art is extraordinarily colourful and makes for amazing fashion. The aesthetic palette typically falls into two categories. The first category is much brighter and focuses on the use of pastels such as greens, turquoise, pinks and light blues. Commonly, scenes of oceans and beaches lined with palm trees combined with contrasting stark offices dotted with potted ferns and malls.
        The second is almost black, yet emphasized with lines of purple, greens, and shades of pinks. Generally, this particular palette is used to portray city scenes in early evening or in the middle of the night. Neon signs glow and cut through the blackness by providing vibrate, colourful scenes.
        Vaporwave's aestetice draws influence from Anime and cartoons, (often from the '70s to '90s but not always, ie. Sailor Moon, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and even The Simpsons, as popularized by artist Lucian Hughes), sculptures such as the Apollo Belvedere and Laocoon, Consumerism (often displays brand names and logos, such as Adidas, Pepsi Cola, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh Plus, PlayStation, Arizona Iced Tea, and Fiji Water).
