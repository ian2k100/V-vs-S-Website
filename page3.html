        <p>Synthwave (also known as Outrun) is a particular aesthetic that draws a lot of inspiration from the 1980s. The genre is credited as being started by acts such as College, Kavinsky, and Justice, although a fair argument could be made that the first big mainstream album evoking the Synthwave vibe and aesthetic could be traced back to the sophomore Daft Punk album, Discovery. The music strongly shares some key traits within the French House/Italo Disco musical genres. The true proto-synthwave acts came from musical scores of films in the 1980s created by the likes of John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing, They Live, etc.), Vangelis (Blade Runner), and Tangerine Dream (Firestarter). While the genre has started to dip in popularity slightly, there is still a very devoted following and a lot of musicians still sell decently.

        <h2 class="headertext">Aesthetics</h2>
        <p> Synthwave visuals draw a lot of inspiration from graphics often seen during the '80s, such as sunset graphics, neon grids, '80s sports cars, wireframe vector graphics, pixel art that is designed to look like an old school 8-bit video game, etc, with a colour palette that uses colours as bold, vibrant, and colourful as the '80s themselves. Synthwave visuals may also borrow very heavily from '80s Cyberpunk (most notably the 1982 film Blade Runner and the 1989 anime Akira) but celebrate the aesthetics of it rather than heeding the initial warnings that were offered by these works about the risks of technology advancing too fast. </p>
